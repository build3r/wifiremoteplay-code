<p>Wifi Remote Play is a free Open Source remote control app for Android and
Symbian smartphones/tablets, allowing you to control
<a href="http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/">Media Player Classic</a> (MPC) or
<a href="http://www.videolan.org/vlc/">VideoLan Client</a> (VLC) over a wireless network. Please
see Instructions below for details on setting it up to work.</p>

<p>This software is completely free - no ads, or having to pay for extra
features, unlike many competing players!</p>

<p><b>Nokia Symbian</b>: <a href="http://store.ovi.com/content/247839">Download free from the Nokia Store!</a> - Downloaded over 2 million times since 25 January 2012!</p>

<p><b>Android</b>: <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=net.sourceforge.wifiremoteplay">Download free from Google Play!</a></p>

<p>For Kindle Fire users note that you cannot access Google Play, and
Wifi Remote Play will not be available from the Amazon store (this would cost me
$99 a year). It is possible to transfer the install application files
<a href="http://www.ubergizmo.com/2011/11/kindle-fire-sideload/">via another
Android device and PC</a>.</p>

<!--<p><b>For Nokia/Symbian phones - if you get "Installation failed", this is due to a Nokia Store fault, and not a problem with my app (they uploaded an incorrectly packaged file). I have notified Nokia of the problem. As a workaround, please try first installing my app Livejournal Qt - this will install the necessary libraries, so that installing Wifi Remote Play should then work (it's okay to then remove Livejournal Qt afterwards). Please don't give me bad 1 star reviews just because of a problem caused by Nokia :)</b></p>-->

<!--<p>To download, use your phone's web browser to go to:
<a href="http://markh.webuda.com/wifiremoteplay_installer.sis">http://markh.webuda.com/wifiremoteplay_installer.sis</a>
(if you're browsing on your phone, just click on the link) (or instead, you can download the
wifiremoteplay_installer.sis file to your PC, and doubleclick on the file to install to the phone over USB).</p>-->

<!--<p>The Symbian installer file is at <a href="wifiremoteplay_installer.sis">wifiremoteplay_installer.sis</a>. You can either download to your PC, and doubleclick on the file to install to the phone over USB; or download on your phone, you'll then have to go to File Manager (Options->Go to File Manager; or select File Manager from the Applications menu), go to "E:", "download", then double tap on wifiremoteplay_installer.sis. (Unfortunately installing from the phone's web browser directly isn't supported, because Virgin Media's web hosting is too crap to support it, so the Symbian installer files get marked as plain text...)
</p>-->

<!--<p>Note that this application is unsigned. To install,
you have to change the settings on your phone to allow all applications rather than just signed applications
(e.g., on the Nokia 5800, go to Settings->Application mgr.->Installation sett., and set Software installation
from "Signed only" to "All"). (Note that you'll still be told when installing an unsigned app, so changing this
setting won't install anything that you don't want.)</p>-->

<p><b>System requirements</b></p>

<p>For Nokia/Symbian, this should work on any device running Symbian S60 5th
edition (Symbian ^1) or better. For Android, this requires Android 2.3.3 or
better. I've tested this successfully on the Samsung Galaxy Nexus, running
Android 4.2.2.</p>

<p>For Android, this requires installing the app
<a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.kde.necessitas.ministro">Ministro</a>, which you should be prompted to do when you first run
Wifi Remote Play (if it's not already installed). Ministro manages the required Qt libraries on Android. These will be
downloaded if required when you first run Wifi Remote Play. If you get an error message such as "Ministro can not
satisfy your application dependencies", please ensure you have enough storage space (the libraries can take up to around
25MB).</p>

<p>I've tested it with Media Player Classic version 1.6.8.7417, and
VLC version 2.0.7. Note that in
old versions of Media Player Classic, the Previous/Next Track buttons won't
work correctly - please upgrade to the latest version of MPC if you have this
problem.</p>

<!--<p><b>Installation notes</b>

<ul>
<li>This application is unsigned, so you'll have to change the settings to allow all applications rather than just
unsigned applications (see above). You'll also get a message about it being unsigned when installing.</li>
<li>An Internet connection is required when installing to download additional Qt for Symbian libraries, if not
aleady installed on your phone (Qt is now the official development environment for Symbian, but the libraries are
not yet shipped on all phones). Note that this may be several MBs (up to 12MB) in size.</li>
<li>You'll have to press "Ok"/"Continue" about five times when installing - this is due to Nokia's "Smart
Installer" (this should hopefully get better in future!), and because of it being unsigned.</li>
</ul></p>-->

<p><a name="#instructions"><b>Instructions</b></p>

<p>To set up <b>Media Player Classic</b>, go to menu View/Options, then under
Player/Web Interface, tick "Listen on port". (Also explained in the
<a href="http://mpc-hc.sourceforge.net/remote-control.html">instructions for
the Android MPC app</a>.)</p>

<p>To set up <b>VLC</b>, go to menu Tools/Preferences, then select "All" under
"Show settings" (bottom left). Then go to Interface/Main interfaces, and tick
"Web" (or "HTTP remote control interface" in versions prior to 2.0.0), then restart
VLC.</p>

<p><i>Note that whilst Wifi Remote Play works with both Media Player Classic
and VLC, there are more features available when used with Media Player Classic
(browser to select new files, and DVD control).</i></p>

<p>When Media Player Classic or VLC is running, start Wifi Remote Play. The
first time you run it, you'll be asked whether you are using it with Media
Player Classic or VLC (n.b., if upgrading from Wifi Remote Play 1.4 or earlier,
it will default to using MPC - use the "Choose player" menu option to change it).
You'll then be asked to enter the <b>IP Address</b> of the machine running Media
Player Classic / VLC. You can find this out by doing
the following on the PC running Media Player Classic / VLC:<ol>
<li>Go to Start->Run (on Windows XP, click Run from the start menu; on Windows 7, type "Run", or go to All Programs->Accessories->Run). Or simply press the Windows key + "R" together.</li>
<li>Type cmd [and press enter].</li>
<li>Type ipconfig [and press enter].</li>
<li>You'll see a load of info - you're looking for "IPv4 Address" (usually listed under a category talking about LAN or Wireless adapter). It will be a string of 4 numbers separated by dots (e.g.,: 192.168.1.1). You should type this into Wifi Remote Play for "IP Address" (including the dots).</li>
<li>For more advice, see <a href="http://www.wikihow.com/Find-the-IP-Address-of-Your-PC">here</a> or <a href="http://www.banamalon.net/android/wiki/index.php?title=IP_address">here</a>.</li>
<li>Note that web pages that show you your IP address may not show you the address that you actually need (if you access the Internet through a router, as is common for wireless modems these days).</li>
<li>Note that although Wifi Remote Play saves the IP Address, if your PC's IP Address changes, you'll need to update it in Wifi Remote Play (press "Options",
then "Settings"). Note that some routers/modems may mean the IP Address changes everytime your PC is rebooted, but there is usually an option to reserve an IP
Address or keep them fixed - please consult your router or modem manual for information.</li>
<li>If things aren't working, make sure that Media Player Classic or VLC isn't being blocked by any Firewall software. One thing to try is to (after closing the
settings window) click "Options" then "Web interface". This opens up the player's web interface in the phone's web browser. If this doesn't appear,
or it doesn't work, then there's something wrong with getting a connection to your PC, and not with Wifi Remote Play :) To be sure, you can also try loading the
page yourself in the phone's browser, going to the URL: http://[IP-Address]]:13579/ for MPC, or http://[IP-Address]]:8080/ for VLC (e.g., <a href="http://192.168.1.1:13579/">http://192.168.1.1:13579/</a> ).</li>
<li>Also if you're using VLC, it <b>may be required to edit the .hosts file</b>:
    <ul>
    <li>On Windows: the file is c:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\http\.hosts or c:\Program Files\VideoLAN\VLC\lua\http\.hosts (or if you're on 64 bit Windows, it might be c:\Program Files (x86)\...).
    On Windows Vista onwards, you'll need admin permissions to edit the file. One way is to copy/paste the file to the desktop, edit it there, then cut/paste it back into the VLC folder.</li>
    <li>On Linux: the file is /usr/share/vlc/http/.hosts or /usr/share/vlc/lua/http/.hosts .</li>
    <li>On Mac OS X: the file is VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/share/http/.hosts or VLC.app/Contents/MacOS/share/lua/http/.hosts .
    <li>To edit, find the bit after "# private addresses", and uncomment (remove the #) of the line relevant for your subnet. Most the time, it will work to remove the "#" character from line 192.168.0.0/16 or 192.168.1.0/16.
    You may need to restart VLC after changing the .hosts file. If you can't get any of this working, I recommend using Media Player Classic instead of VLC, as it's easier to set up.</li>
    </ul>
</li>
</ol>
<b>Port</b> should be left at the default, unless you've changed it in Media Player Classic / VLC. Click
Okay, and you'll be presented with an interface:<ul>
<li><b>&lt;&lt;</b> - Previous track.</li>
<li><b>&lt;</b> - Skip backwards 5 seconds.</li>
<li><b>Play/Pause</b> - Toggle between playing and paused.</li>
<li><b>&gt;</b> - Skip forwards 5 seconds.</li>
<li><b>&gt;&gt;</b> - Next track.</li>
<li><b>-/+</b> - Change volume.</li>
<li><b>mute</b> - Mute/unmute volume. Note that on VLC, this only mutes volume; use the + to increase the volume again.</li>
<li><b>DVD</b> - (Media Player Classic only.) Opens up the DVD interface, allowing you to control DVD menu screens.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>At the top of the screen will be displayed the name of the current track, the current position, and total
length. The slider shows the current position, and allows you to jump to any position in the track. The user
interface displays best when the phone is held in landscape mode (this is especially true for lower resolution
Android devices).</p>

<p>Note that the displayed current time is an estimate, updated every 5 seconds, so it won't always be exactly
accurate (there also seems to be an issue in Media Player Classic which means the status of playing or paused isn't returned correctly in full screen mode, meaning the app has to estimate this). Similarly, when changing tracks it may
take a few seconds for the status to update.</p>

<p>The following menu options are available (on Symbian press "Option"; on Android, press your device's menu button):<ul>
<li><b>Settings</b> - Open the settings window, to change the IP address or port.</li>
<li><b>Toggle full screen</b> - Switch between windowed and full screen mode.</li>
<li><b>Open file browser</b> - (Media Player Classic only.) Allows you to browse the computer's hard disk and select a file to open. Click
"Close" to go back to the main interface (whether or not you've selected a new file). Note that there is a known issue in that some files with non-ASCII unicode characters won't load (seems to be a problem with the MPC web interface, as far as I can tell).</li>
<li><b>Choose player</b> - Choose between using Media Player Classic or VLC.</li>
<li><b>Online help</b> - Loads this web page in the phone's browser.</li>
<li><b>Web interface</b> - Opens up the Media Player Classic or VLC web interface. This gives the full range of options (though doesn't fit so well on a phone... but
still useful for testing, or for features not yet supported natively in Wifi Remote Play).</li>
<li><b>About</b> - Displays basic information about the program.</li>
</ul></p>

<p>Network activity is suspended when the application isn't active, or the phone screen is blanked, in an attempt
to save on battery life :)</p>

<!--<p>On Android, the screen display is kept on when Wifi Remote Play is running as the foreground app (if
you want to switch off the display, do so on your phone manually).</p>-->
